# Velora-meteor-impact-simulator
Velora-meteor-impact-simulator is an interactive HTML platform to explore and filter past, present, and predicted future asteroid impacts, seeing where they hit on a live map, how they affect people and what the global costs might be. Itâ€™s paired with a realistic 3D physics-based simulation that lets users visualize how asteroids collide with or can be deflected from Earth.

The folder includes 3 files:
- An html file which you can open in your browser upon download (the base of the project- usable on any device) {Velora.html}
- A .txt file which has all the code {Velora-html-code.txt}
- A video file showcasing the 3D Physics based simulation (if you don't want to download it) {Velora.mp4}
- A .blend file (the simulation file) {Velora.blend}
- readme

In order to access the html file to its full extent please:
						- Download the file from GitHub
						- Open in your devices native browser

In order to access the 3D Simulation properly you must:
						- Download and install blender 4.1 or later
						- Open the file
						
Instructions for 3D sim file:

			- Open file in blender
			- Click and hold z on your keyboard and move the mouse to:"Rendered" 
			- Click on the asteroid 
			- If the menu on the right (labeled transform) doesn't appear on its own please press: "N"
			- Under the dimensions tab you can change the size of the asteroid (1m=1km for performance purposes)
			- Press: "G" in order to move the asteroid around the leftclick to set it positon
			- Press the SpaceBar to start the simulation, press it again to pause
			- Press: " Shift+Leftarrow" to reset the timeline

If you don't have blender and do not want to download it you can view the {Velora.mp4} file for a video preview showcasing all the features
